in the url manager :
  'class' => 'codemix\localeurls\UrlManager',
                'languages' => ['en-US', 'en', 'fr', 'de', 'es-*'],
                'enableDefaultLanguageUrlCode' => true,
                'enableLanguagePersistence' => false,


to install the codemix:
 composer require codemix/yii2-localeurls

*create a folder named messages :
and create inside this folder anoter folders with name of  like ('en-US', 'en', 'fr', 'de', 'es-)
and inside thes folder create a file with name app.php and inside this app set return ['key of the world to convert it '=>'the reanslation']

in the view we set the following code :

<?= Html::a('France', ['site/index', 'language' => 'fr']) ?>
<?= Html::a('English', ['site/index', 'language' => 'en-Us']) ?>
this code will call fr folder and en-Us folder if you clik both of them
